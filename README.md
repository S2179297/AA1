### Report of AA1 Case Study for Izzah Athirah binti Mohamad Radzi

#### Project Overview 
The objective of the case study is to analyze customer behavior to plan out marketing strategies. By understanding how customers respond to promotional efforts, businesses can tailor marketing campaigns for better engagement and conversion rates. 
I've used Talend Data Prep in the project to spot columns with missing values and to convert nominal data into binary data for 'Gender' column. SAS Enterprise Miner was being used for the whole analysis from imputing the missing values from the data set, to use Decision Tree, HP Forest as well as Gradient Boosting models and finally for models comparison.

#### Data Files

#### Reflections or Learning Outcomes 

##### Lessons Learned:

1. **Understanding Metrics:** Familiarity with diverse evaluation metrics (e.g., Average Squared Error, Root Average Squared Error) aids in effectively assessing model performance.
2. **Model Comprehension:** Acquiring the ability to interpret intricate models like decision trees or ensemble methods is crucial in understanding the underlying insights into customer behavior.
3. **Data Preparation:** Vital steps in predictive modeling encompass data preparation, handling missing values, imputing data, and selecting variables.

##### Challenges:

1. **Data Quality and Availability:** Not easy to find data that meets the requirements.
2. **Interpreting Models Output:** Understanding and interpreting models outputs with only basic knowledege about the models
3. **Avoiding Model Biases:** Striking a balance between model complexity to prevent overfitting or underfitting.

##### Overcoming Challenges:

1. **Data Cleaning and Exploration:** Rigorous data cleaning, imputation, and exploratory data analysis are key in identifying patterns and addressing data quality concerns.
2. **Simplifying Model Interpretation:** Utilizing visualization tools aids in conveying model outputs effectively.
3. **Robust Model Evaluation:** Conducting thorough model evaluation and hyperparameter tuning are critical to ensuring model robustness.
